# v2.7.1 — Demo Chat Area Min-Height Fix

## Summary
After demo playback completes and the summary panel appears, the chat conversation area was collapsing to a very short height. Fixed by switching the interview container from fixed `height` to `min-height` and adding a `min-height: 300px` on the chat area.

## Changes
- `client/src/pages/Interview.css` — Changed `.interview` from `height` to `min-height` so the container grows to fit both chat and summary. Added `min-height: 300px` to `.chat-area`.
- `client/src/App.jsx` — Version bump
- `package.json` — Version bump
