# v2.1.1 — Pipeline Bug Fixes

**Released:** 2026-02-13

## Fixes

### Consolidated pipeline into single serverless function
- Vercel Hobby plan has a 12 serverless function limit; the 8 separate pipeline routes + cron pushed it over
- All pipeline actions now consolidated into `api/pipeline.js` dispatching by `?action=` query param
- Frontend API client updated to use the new URL pattern

### Deployed apps now publicly accessible
- Vercel team deployments have Deployment Protection enabled by default, requiring login
- Deployer now disables authentication on demo projects via PATCH after creation
- Deployments explicitly aliased to `bench-demo-*.vercel.app` so the pre-announced target URL works

### All buttons now tear down deployed apps
- Clear, Start Over, and Cancel Pipeline all call `api.cleanup()` to delete the demo project
- Previously only Start Over cleaned up; Clear just reset the UI and Cancel did nothing

### Fixed stale closure in cleanup callbacks
- `useCallback` captured stale `projectName` from render closure
- All cleanup actions now read from a `projectNameRef` ref that always holds the current value
