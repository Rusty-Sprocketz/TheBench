# v2.5.2 — Pipeline Stage Display Fixes

## What Changed

### Bug Fixer: Show what was fixed
- Added expandable "View Fixes" section to the Bug Fixer stage showing fix notes and the list of patched files

### Reviewer: Replace misleading score with item counts
- Removed arbitrary "Score: X/10" display — it had no relation to actual review items
- Now shows actual counts: "PASS — 5 passed — 1 warnings" derived from the review items
- Removed `score` field from Reviewer agent prompt

### General
- Fixed pluralization in fixer summary ("1 file" vs "2 files")

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/PipelineStage.jsx` (fixer details, reviewer summary, pluralization)
- `client/src/components/PipelineStage.css` (fixer file item styles)
- `api/pipeline.js` (removed score from Reviewer prompt schema)
- `client/src/App.jsx` (version bump)
- `package.json` (version bump)
