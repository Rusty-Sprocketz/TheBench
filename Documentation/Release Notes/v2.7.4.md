# v2.7.4 — Sticky Header Panels + Hide Input in Demo Mode

## Changes

### Sticky top panels on mobile
- Wrapped demo-banner, agent-tabs, and agent-header in a `.interview-top` container with `position: sticky`
- Top panels now stay pinned at the top of the viewport as chat content scrolls
- Users always see which agent is active during demo playback

### Hide input area during demo mode
- Textarea is now hidden when demo mode is active, preventing the mobile keyboard from opening during demo playback
- Focus useEffect skips firing during demo mode, eliminating screen shifts caused by keyboard popup

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/Interview.jsx` — Wrapped top panels in `.interview-top` div, added `!demoMode` guard to input render and focus effect
- `client/src/pages/Interview.css` — Added `.interview-top` sticky styles, removed redundant `flex-shrink: 0` from child elements
- `client/src/App.jsx` — Version bump
- `package.json` — Version bump
