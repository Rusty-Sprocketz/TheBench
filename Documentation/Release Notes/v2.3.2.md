# v2.3.2 — Fix Confusing "All Pending" Error State

**Released:** 2026-02-13

## Fixes

### Preflight failure no longer shows all stages as PENDING
- When the preflight check fails (rate limit, too many active demos, network error), the pipeline errored out but all visible stages remained stuck at PENDING with no explanation
- Root cause: Preflight is a hidden stage — its error was never surfaced to the user
- Fix: When preflight fails, the stages list is now hidden entirely (since nothing ran) and the error banner shows the specific preflight error message (e.g. "Rate limited. Try again in 28 minutes.")
- The Start Over and Clear buttons still appear so the user can reset
