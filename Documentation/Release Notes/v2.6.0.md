# v2.6.0 — Landing Page Two-Column Feature Layout

## What Changed
- Rewrote the landing page to promote Interview and Pipeline as equal peers in a two-column layout
- Hero subtitle replaced with bold punchy statement: "Two ways to prove I can direct AI agents — interview me, or watch them build."
- Hero CTA buttons replaced with a clean "How This Was Made →" text link
- Interview column (blue): "Multi-Agent Interview" header, subtitle, CTA, The Interview Panel (3 agent cards), The Candidate (Rusty's story — preserved exactly)
- Pipeline column (purple): "Agentic Pipeline Demo" header, subtitle, CTA, The Agent Team (6 role cards with stage colors), What Gets Built (pipeline output description)
- Pipeline role cards use matching stage colors: Architect (blue), Builder (green), Reviewer (amber), Tester (purple), Bug Fixer (orange), Deployer (red)
- Mobile responsive: columns stack vertically at <768px, Interview on top

## Why This Matters
The homepage originally treated Interview as the primary feature with Pipeline added as a secondary CTA. This rewrite gives both features equal visual weight and narrative depth, reflecting that both are core demonstrations of AI agent orchestration.
