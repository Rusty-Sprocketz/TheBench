# v2.1.0 — Live AgentOps Pipeline

**Released:** 2026-02-13

## What's New

### Live Pipeline Demo on AgentOps Page
The AgentOps page now features a **live pipeline demo** where visitors can watch 5 AI agents design, build, review, test, and deploy a real application in real-time.

- **Architect Agent (Claude)** — picks an app type, variant, and visual theme, producing a structured spec
- **Builder Agent (Claude)** — generates complete deployment-ready files from the spec
- **Reviewer Agent (GPT-4o)** — reviews the code for correctness, security, and accessibility
- **Test Agent (Gemini Flash)** — runs structural test assertions against the generated code
- **Deploy Agent (Vercel API)** — deploys the app to a live URL on Vercel

### App Types
Each run produces a genuinely different app. The Architect chooses from:
- **AI Micro-Tools** — haiku generator, emoji translator, ELI5 explainer, fortune teller
- **Text Transformers** — word frequency counter, reading time estimator, text stats dashboard
- **Utility Calculators** — color contrast checker, password strength analyzer, JSON formatter

### Deployed App Features
- Functional tool with real backend logic
- "How I Was Built" panel showing each agent's real output
- Themed with unique color palettes per run
- Self-destructs after 1 hour

### Safety & Rate Limiting
- One deployment per IP per 30 minutes
- Max 3 active demo projects globally
- Triple-redundant cleanup: lazy cleanup, client countdown, daily cron job

## New Files
- `api/pipeline/` — 7 serverless API routes (preflight, architect, builder, reviewer, tester, deployer, check-url, cleanup)
- `api/cron/cleanup.js` — daily safety-net cron for stale demo projects
- `client/src/components/PipelineDemo.jsx` — main demo orchestrator component
- `client/src/components/PipelineStage.jsx` — individual stage card with status/output
- `client/src/components/DeployedApp.jsx` — post-deploy view with countdown and source viewer
- `client/src/hooks/usePipeline.js` — state machine managing the full pipeline lifecycle
- `client/src/utils/pipelineApi.js` — API client for all pipeline endpoints

## Modified Files
- `client/src/pages/AgentOps.jsx` — added live demo section above existing explainer
- `vercel.json` — added cron configuration

## Environment Variables Required
- `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` — Vercel personal access token with project create/delete permissions
