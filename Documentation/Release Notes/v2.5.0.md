# v2.5.0 — Smoke Test Failure Triggers Fixer + Redeploy Loop

## What Changed
- When the post-deploy smoke test fails, the pipeline now loops back to the Bug Fixer agent with the smoke test failure details (HTTP status, response body), then cleans up the broken deployment and redeploys with the fixed code
- The Fixer backend now accepts `smokeTestFailure` as an alternative to `testResults`, with specific guidance on common runtime issues (wrong Gemini API usage, missing try/catch, incorrect exports)
- The `runFixer` API function now supports an optional `smokeTestFailure` parameter
- Pipeline flow is now: Architect → Builder → Reviewer → Tester → Fixer (if tests fail) → Deploy → **Fixer + Redeploy (if smoke test fails)**
- Maximum one fix-redeploy retry to avoid infinite loops

## Why This Matters
Previously, the smoke test ran inside the Deployer stage — after deployment. If the generated app's API endpoint was broken at runtime, the pipeline reported "smoke test failed" but couldn't do anything about it. Now the Fixer gets a chance to fix the code before redeploying.

## Files Modified
- `api/pipeline.js` (Fixer handler — accepts smokeTestFailure)
- `client/src/hooks/usePipeline.js` (deploy loop with smoke test → fixer → redeploy)
- `client/src/utils/pipelineApi.js` (runFixer accepts smokeTestFailure param)
- `client/src/App.jsx` (version bump)
- `package.json` (version bump)
