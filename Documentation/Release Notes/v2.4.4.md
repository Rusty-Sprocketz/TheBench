# v2.4.4 — Fix broken API in pipeline-generated AI apps

## What Changed
- Replaced vague Builder rule #7 ("should use the Gemini API") with an exact working code template showing the correct initialization, model ID, response extraction pattern (`result.response.text()`), and try/catch error handling
- Added mandatory try/catch with JSON error response for computation apps (rule #8) too
- This fixes the "smoke test failed — app API may not work" issue where generated `api/generate.js` functions had broken Gemini API calls or missing error handling

## Root Cause
The Builder agent was generating `api/generate.js` with incorrect Gemini API patterns — wrong response extraction, missing try/catch, or malformed function structure — because the prompt only said "should use the Gemini API" without showing the exact working pattern.

## Files Modified
- `api/pipeline.js` (Builder prompt rules #7 and #8)
- `client/src/App.jsx` (version bump)
- `package.json` (version bump)
