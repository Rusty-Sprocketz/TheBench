# v2.7.5 — Fix interview panels behind nav + hide footer

## Changes

### Hide footer on interview page
- Footer was always visible below the interview layout, making the page scrollable beyond the interview area
- Footer is now conditionally hidden when on `/interview`, preventing unwanted page scroll

### Fix top panels overlapping with nav
- Removed `position: sticky; top: 0` from `.interview-top` — this was causing panels to stick at the viewport top, sliding behind the nav bar (which is also sticky at `top: 0` with higher z-index)
- Panels stay in place naturally since `.chat-area` handles its own internal scrolling
- Added `overflow: hidden` to `.interview` container as a safety belt against page scroll

## Files Modified
- `client/src/App.jsx` — Conditionally hide footer on interview page, version bump
- `client/src/pages/Interview.css` — Remove sticky positioning, add overflow hidden
- `package.json` — Version bump
