# v2.9.1 — Sequential Variant Testing Mode

## Changes
- **Sequential variant cycling**: Architect now cycles through all 10 app variants in order instead of picking randomly, so every variant can be tested systematically
- **Reduced rate limit**: Dropped from 30 minutes to 2 minutes for faster testing turnaround

### Variant order:
1. Haiku Generator (ai-micro-tool)
2. Emoji Translator (ai-micro-tool)
3. ELI5 Explainer (ai-micro-tool)
4. Fortune Teller (ai-micro-tool)
5. Word Frequency Counter (text-transformer)
6. Reading Time Estimator (text-transformer)
7. Text Statistics Dashboard (text-transformer)
8. Color Contrast Checker (utility-calculator)
9. Password Strength Analyzer (utility-calculator)
10. JSON Formatter (utility-calculator)

**Note**: These are temporary testing changes. Revert to random selection and 30-minute rate limit after testing is complete.
