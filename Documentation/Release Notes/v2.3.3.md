# v2.3.3 — Fix "[object Object]" in Build Log Panel

**Released:** 2026-02-13

## Fixes

### "How I Was Built" panel now renders actual content instead of [object Object]
- Root cause: Builder prompt told the AI to "populate panel divs from buildLog.architect, buildLog.builder..." but these are nested objects, not strings. The generated app.js assigned objects directly to `.textContent`, producing `[object Object]`.
- Fix: Builder prompt rule #4 now includes explicit formatting instructions for each build log section — which properties to extract, how to render arrays, and a fallback pattern using `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` in `<pre>` tags.

### Tester now catches [object Object] rendering bugs
- New test #8: Checks that app.js never assigns a raw object to `.textContent` or `.innerHTML`. Specifically looks for patterns where build log objects are used without extracting string properties.

### Fixer knows about the pattern too
- Fixer rule #8: Explicit instruction that build log sections are objects, not strings, and must never be assigned directly to DOM elements.
