# v2.7.3 — Typewriter Demo + Fixed Chat Height

**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Changes

### Typewriter effect in demo mode
- Assistant messages now reveal character by character (~3 chars/15ms) instead of appearing as full blocks
- User messages still appear instantly (they represent what the candidate typed)
- Verdict messages also typewrite for consistency
- Slightly slower pacing: 400ms before typing indicator, 800ms typing dots, 500ms post-message pause, 1s post-verdict, 800ms between agents
- Clean abort when exiting demo mid-typewrite

### Fixed-height chat layout
- Interview page now uses fixed `height` instead of `min-height`, preventing the chat from pushing tabs and summary off-screen
- Chat area scrolls independently within a flex container
- Agent tabs, header, and demo banner pinned with `flex-shrink: 0`
- Summary panel capped at 45vh with its own scroll, stays visible below chat
