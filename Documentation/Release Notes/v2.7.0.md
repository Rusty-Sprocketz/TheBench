# v2.7.0 — Mobile UX Overhaul + Demo Playback

## Summary
Major mobile experience improvements across Landing, How It Works, and Interview pages, plus a sequential playback system for the demo interview.

## Changes

### Landing Page Mobile Toggle
- Added "Interview Me" / "Watch Them Build" toggle bar on mobile (hidden on desktop)
- Toggles between Interview and Pipeline columns instead of stacking both
- Desktop layout completely unaffected

### How It Works Mobile Toggle
- Same toggle pattern applied to the How It Works page
- Hides inactive columns and column headers across all 7 sections on mobile
- "Why This Role, Why Now" section unaffected (full-width, no columns)

### Mobile Interview Chat Visibility
- Kept agent tabs horizontal on mobile (removed `flex-direction: column`)
- Compacted tab padding, font size, and indicators to save vertical space
- Hidden agent description on mobile to reclaim space
- Reduced demo banner and agent header padding
- ~130px returned to chat area

### Demo Interview Sequential Playback
- Demo messages now appear one at a time with typing indicators
- User messages appear with 300ms pause, typing indicator shows for 600ms, then agent response appears
- Auto-switches between agents with 600ms gap
- Verdict messages get 800ms pause for readability
- Total playback ~15 seconds
- Exiting demo mid-playback aborts cleanly via abort ref
