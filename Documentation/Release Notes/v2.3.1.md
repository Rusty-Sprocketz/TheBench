# v2.3.1 — Better Error Visibility for Pipeline Failures

**Released:** 2026-02-13

## Changes

### Error guidance banner
- When a pipeline stage fails, a banner now appears: "Agents are attempting to build this app live — sometimes things go wrong. Try Retry Stage on the failed step. If that doesn't work, scroll down and hit Start Over."

### Expandable error details
- Failed stages now show a "View Error Detail" expandable section with the full backend error message
- Error detail is captured from the API response's `detail` field and stored alongside the summary error
- Helps debugging prompt issues by showing exactly what went wrong (e.g. malformed JSON, missing fields, API timeouts)

### Technical
- `usePipeline` hook now captures `err.detail` from API responses into `errorDetail` field on stage state
- `PipelineStage` renders error detail in a `<details>` element with monospace formatting
