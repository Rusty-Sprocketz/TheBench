# v2.9.0 — Pipeline Resilience: Truncation, Retry, and Rate Limit Fixes

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Builder JSON truncation ("Unterminated string in JSON")
The Builder's `max_tokens` was set to 8192, which is insufficient for complex apps with 6 files. When the LLM output hit the token limit, the JSON was truncated mid-string, causing a parse error.

**Fix**: Increased `max_tokens` from 8192 to 16384 for both Builder and Fixer.

### 2. "Retry Stage" completes but pipeline doesn't continue
Clicking retry on a failed stage would re-run that single stage, then set pipeline status to `'error'` without triggering subsequent stages. The user was stuck with no way to continue.

**Fix**: `retryStage` now resumes the full pipeline from the retried stage forward — running all subsequent stages (builder → reviewer → tester → fixer → deployer) including the fix loop and smoke test retry logic.

### 3. "Start Over" hits rate limit
Clicking "Start Over" called `launch()` which ran preflight again, hitting the 30-minute IP rate limit set during the original run.

**Fix**: `startOver` now generates a new project name locally and passes it to `launch({ reuseProjectName })`, skipping the rate-limited preflight. The rate limit still applies to truly fresh pipeline starts from the landing page.
